Hey,
Thanks for using our Heatmap generator tool.

You will find two main prefabs: DataSender and DataRepresentation

How to use:
	1. Drag DataSender on any scene you want to get data.
	2. The script DataSender.cs contains a collecion of static functions that you can implement wherever you desire.
	3. Drag DataRepresentation on the scene you want to display the heatmap.
	4. Once playing to change displayed data:
		- F1: Position
		- F2: Jump
		- F3: Attack
		- F4: Death
		- F5: Hit
		- F6: Heal
		- F7: Checkpoint
		- F8: Interactuable
		- F9: Reload Information (do this any time you change something in the editor like. Ex: cellSize)

	5. DataReader allData checkbox -> deactivate to see specific playerID data
